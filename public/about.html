<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm Nirmal Parmar and I have done my B.Tech in Mechanical Engineering from Nirma University, Ahmedabad.</p>

<p>So, How and why I started learning web developement? I have always the curiosity to know how computers work! So I started to watch Harvards Introduction to Computer Science course. Where I came to know about various fields of the computer science. With the time I wanted to create something on my own so i decided to learn some coding.</p>

<p>I have started many different things and left many times(like Python and C) because of lack of clarity that how should i learn step by step. One of my friend working as a full stack developer advised me to start with the Web developement just because you can see what you're doing and when you can see what impact you're making, you get motivated to learn more. Currently I'm on my way to finish the first step as web developer. Soon, I'll become a web developer soon.</p>
